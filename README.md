## Motley Fool Developer Interview Project - Corey Bishop

Overview
This is a my Motley Fool Developer interview project It is a simple news website that diplays articles from a json data file. When you click on an article headline, the full article is displayed along with stock quotes related to the articled.

Since I'm new to python and django, I kept things pretty simple. Let me know if you have any questions.

I created User Stories and Acceptance Criteria for this project. That can be seen here: https://github.com/bishoco/foolish-project/wiki/User-Stories

I also created a task board which helped keep track of what I was doing (and my sanity). It can be seen here: https://github.com/bishoco/foolish-project/projects/1
